  Mixing parameter for charge density mixing has not been set.
  Using default: charge_mix_param =     0.0500.
  The mixing parameter will be adjusted in iteration number     2 of each s.c.f. cycle (i.e., each geometry step).
  Algorithm-dependent basis array size parameters:

  Maximum number of self-consistency iterations not provided.
  Presetting  1000 iterations.
  Presetting      1001 iterations before the initial mixing cycle
  is restarted anyway using the sc_init_iter criterion / keyword.
  Presetting a factor      1.000 between actual scf density residual
  and density convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho below which sc_init_iter
  takes no effect.
 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.
 * The run will proceed with a reasonable default guess, but please check whether.
 * the s.c.f. cycles seem to take too much or too little time.
  Calculation of forces was not defined in control.in. No forces will be calculated.
  Geometry relaxation not requested: no relaxation will be performed.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.112694E-04 .
  No accuracy limit for integral partition fn. given. Defaulting to  0.1000E-14.

  Will not use alltoall communication since running on < 1024 CPUs.
  Threshold for basis singularities not set.
  Default threshold for basis singularities:  0.1000E-04
  partition_type (choice of integration weights) for integrals was not specified.
  | Using a version of the partition function of Stratmann and coworkers ('stratmann_sparse').
  | At each grid point, the set of atoms used to build the partition table is smoothly restricted to
  | only those atoms whose free-atom density would be non-zero at that grid point.
  Partitioning for Hartree potential was not defined. Using partition_type for integrals.
  | Adjusted default value of keyword multip_moments_threshold to:       0.10000000E-11
  | This value may affect high angular momentum components of the Hartree potential in periodic systems.
  Angular momentum expansion for Kerker preconditioner not set explicitly.
  | Using default value of   0
  No explicit requirement for turning off preconditioner.
  | By default, it will be turned off when the charge convergence reaches
  | sc_accuracy_rho  =   0.112694E-04
  No special mixing parameter while Kerker preconditioner is on.
  Using default: charge_mix_param =     0.0500.
  No q(lm)/r^(l+1) cutoff set for long-range Hartree potential.
  | Using default value of  0.100000E-09 .

  Defaulting to new monopole extrapolation.
  Density update method: automatic selection selected.
  Using density matrix based charge density update.
  Using density matrix based charge density update.
  Using packed matrix style: index .
  Defaulting to use time-reversal symmetry for k-point grid.
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.
  Found no potential conflicts with setting 'use_local_index' for this calculation.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.59261431 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -4.27332369 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.
  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.31929062 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.38553702 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.69306158 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -4.32238508 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       2 at    0.000000    0.500000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.
  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.37067650 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 2
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.38441179 eV for k_point 2 at    0.000000    0.500000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -5.00772333 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:      359.196 MB (on task 159 after allocating wave)
          |   Maximum:      405.942 MB (on task 116 after allocating wave)
          |   Average:      384.171 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:       98.734 MB (ovlp_complex on task  77)
          |   Maximum:       99.988 MB (ovlp_complex on task   0)
          |   Average:       99.674 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
